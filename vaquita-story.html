      <h1>The Story of Vaquitas</h1>
      <p id="story-text">
        Vaquitas, the world's most endangered marine mammal, have been pushed to the brink of extinction. These small porpoises are found exclusively in the northern part of the Gulf of California, Mexico. 
        Their population has plummeted due to bycatch in gillnets used for illegal fishing of the Totoaba fish, whose swim bladder is highly valued in certain markets. 
        With fewer than 10 individuals remaining, immediate action is critical to save them from vanishing forever.
